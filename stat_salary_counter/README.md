## Introduction

The script reads a salary_file.txt containing names and salaries of employees in a department, and returns a tuple: (total_salary, average_salary).

## Usage

Place salary_file.txt in the project root directory and run the program.

## Structure

- main.py – entry point of the script
- utils/ – global constants and shared helper functions
- handlers/ – core logic and handler methods; may include local utils.py for handler-specific helpers
